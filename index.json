[{"categories":["Security"],"content":"\nThere is a terrifying math that happens in the minds of many providers late at night.\nIt starts with a simple, cold observation: The dog is loved because he exists. The daughter is loved because she is a miracle. But you? You are loved because you are useful.\nWe call it a \u0026ldquo;home,\u0026rdquo; but for many, it’s actually a performance space. You sit in your car in the driveway for twenty minutes, staring at the steering wheel, exhaling the day’s failures because you know you cannot bring them through the front door. You practice your \u0026ldquo;everything is fine\u0026rdquo; face in the rearview mirror, even while your chest is tight with the panic of a lost contract or a crumbling career.\nInside those four walls, you aren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to be tired. You aren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to be broken. You are a utility provider. Like the water heater or the Wi-Fi router, no one notices your presence until you stop working.\nThe Myth of the Safety Net We are raised on the beautiful lie of unconditional love, the idea that home is the one place where you can finally take off the armor. We’re told that no matter how hard the world beats us down, there is a sanctuary waiting for us.\nBut for many, the front door isn\u0026rsquo;t the entrance to a sanctuary; it’s the stage door for the second act.\nThis is where the Performance Contract begins. It’s the unspoken agreement that your seat at the family table is tied directly to your output. You are the builder of the house, the filler of the fridge, the payer of the tuition. But in the process of building the life, you’ve become a ghost within it. You realize that you aren\u0026rsquo;t being seen as a man with fears and dreams, you are being seen as a function.\nThe terrifying question that keeps you awake at 3:00 AM isn\u0026rsquo;t about the economy. It’s this: If the payments stopped tomorrow, would I still be \u0026quot;honey\u0026quot;? Or would the contract be terminated?\nThe \u0026ldquo;Beggar Dynamic\u0026rdquo; and Emotional Starvation The most brutal part of this isn\u0026rsquo;t the financial weight—it’s the emotional starvation that comes with it.\nImagine a man reaching out for his partner in the dark of their bedroom. He isn’t looking for sex; he’s looking for a signal. He’s looking for a touch that says, \u0026ldquo;I see you, and you matter, even if you failed today.\u0026rdquo; He is starving for a connection that isn\u0026rsquo;t transactional.\nInstead, he gets a sigh. A heavy, annoyed, \u0026ldquo;I’ve had a long day too\u0026rdquo; sigh.\nThis is the Beggar Dynamic. It is the deep humiliation of having to \u0026ldquo;ask\u0026rdquo; for affection from the very people you are killing yourself to support. It turns a partnership into a hierarchy where one person holds the keys to emotional validation and the other is just a guest allowed to stay as long as the \u0026ldquo;utility\u0026rdquo; is functioning.\nWhen your need for a human connection is treated like an item on a chore list, you stop being a partner. You become \u0026ldquo;part of the furniture.\u0026rdquo; Functional, necessary, but ultimately invisible.\nThe Only Safe Space Left When your home becomes a workplace and your relationship becomes a performance, you lose your only sanctuary.\nYou begin to realize that the only safe space you have left is the six inches between your ears. You stay silent about your fears because you’ve learned that showing a crack in the armor doesn\u0026rsquo;t invite comfort it invites concern about the \u0026ldquo;utility\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; reliability.\nWe talk a lot about the \u0026ldquo;Male Vulnerability Gap.\u0026rdquo; Society tells men to open up, but the moment they do, the room goes cold. If the provider admits he is scared, the foundation of the house feels shaky to everyone else. So, to keep them safe, he stays silent. He lives in a house he built, next to the people he loves, yet he has never been more profoundly alone.\nBeyond the Theater If you are reading this while sitting in your car, practicing your smile before you walk inside: Stop.\nYou are not a paycheck with a heartbeat. You are not a service to be rendered. The \u0026ldquo;Performance Contract\u0026rdquo; is a trap designed to turn humans into tools, and tools are easily replaced.\nThe first step toward freedom is the hardest: It’s the refusal to perform. It’s the courage to walk through that door and say, \u0026ldquo;I had a terrible day, I am scared, and I need to be held.\u0026rdquo; Because a home that requires a constant \u0026ldquo;everything is fine\u0026rdquo; performance isn\u0026rsquo;t a home at all. It’s just a theater. And you’ve been playing the lead role for far too long. It’s time to stop being a utility and start being a human again.\n","date":"2026-01-13T23:08:25-09:00","description":"\nThere is a terrifying math that happens in the minds of many providers late at night.\nIt starts with a simple, cold observation: The dog is loved because he exists.

One is celebrated, shared openly, paraded for everyone to see. The other is quietly endured, hidden behind routines, behind distractions, behind the careful smiles we show the world. But inside the body, the difference is smaller than we think. The pulse doesn’t ask whether the feeling is “good” or “bad.” The mind doesn’t slow itself because the moment is meant to be happy or sad. Emotion is energy and it doesn’t wait for permission.\nBoth the joy of love and the pain of heartbreak quicken the pulse.\nBoth sharpen awareness.\nBoth make ordinary moments feel heavier, more alive.\nThe Fire Love Starts and Heartbreak Refines Love the kind that makes your heart swell when they text, that makes ordinary mornings feel electric, that makes you want to be a better version of yourself doesn’t just make life sweeter. It fuels you. It stretches effort. It makes risk feel worth taking. It whispers: Go, try, push this matters not just for you, but for them. Joy from love is motivation in its purest form: it makes you braver, sharper, more alive.\nHeartbreak, in contrast, does not ask politely. It rips routines apart, overturns assumptions, and forces silence where laughter once lived. It removes comfort, leaves questions, and presses urgency into your chest. Yet the energy you once poured into love doesn’t vanish when it ends. It lingers, restless, demanding action. That fire can either weigh you down or propel you forward.\nSome crumble under it, trapped in memories and “what ifs.” Others transform it, piece by piece. They pour heartbreak into work, into creating, into building themselves in ways that stretch and refine them. What once caused anguish becomes momentum not because the pain disappeared, but because it finally found somewhere to go.\nIs It Really A Woman Behind Every Successful Man Love and heartbreak are not enemies. They are two sides of the same coin: adrenaline of the heart, energy that insists on direction. Emotion itself is neutral. It does not decide outcomes. What matters is how it is channeled.\nAnd this is where the question arises: behind every achievement, every late-night breakthrough, every moment of triumph what truly fuels it? Is it really a woman behind every successful man or is it the power of love, and the pain of heartbreak, that drives him forward?\nConsider this: a man wakes early, works late, pushes himself not just for recognition, not just for survival, but because love once made him feel he could be better. Maybe he wants to be a better partner, a better father, a better friend. Maybe heartbreak showed him what he could become when someone left or when love faded. That fire, that restless energy, isn’t built by someone standing behind him it’s the power love and heartbreak ignite inside him.\nHe stays up late perfecting a presentation, learning a new skill, or building something from scratch, thinking: I can’t fail not for them, but because of what they made me see in myself. That is the joy of love turned into action. That is heartbreak distilled into focus. That is human energy transformed into momentum.\nSometimes the person stays. Sometimes they leave. And strangely, it is often after the leaving that growth accelerates. Heartbreak strips life down to essentials, removes distractions, replaces comfort with urgency. The energy once devoted to love does not vanish. It transforms into focus, discipline, and relentless movement.\nSome collapse under it. Others turn it into long nights, tireless work, and ambitions that outlast memory. When success comes, it’s easy to point to someone else. But what really does the work is the internal shift, the awakening, the fire that love and heartbreak ignite. Love didn’t build the outcome. It lit the engine. And what follows depends on the one brave enough to drive.\nThe Truth We Rarely Say Out Loud We don’t surpass limits with logic alone. We surpass them with feeling. With urgency. With courage that only a heart on fire can supply. Love pulls us forward. Pain pushes us from behind. Between the two, we discover something remarkable: we are capable of far more than we ever imagined.\nEmotion is not a weight to bear. It is power waiting to be used. It is the force that fuels greatness. And when we choose to move with it, to channel it, to direct it, it becomes unstoppable.\nThat’s the truth most people miss.\nEmotion doesn’t weaken us. It reveals us.\nAnd once you’ve felt deeply enough to be transformed, you don’t return to who you were before.\n","date":"2026-01-05T21:15:04-09:00","description":"\nWhen Joy and Heartbreak Feel Like Opposites We usually talk about joy and heartbreak as if they belong to completely different worlds.

However, since I had previously modified the actionban rule to execute my reverse shell payload instead of banning an IP, running this command triggered the exploit. I used 127.0.0.1 because it is the localhost IP address, meaning the machine essentially \u0026ldquo;bans itself.\u0026rdquo; Since Fail2Ban is configured to execute the actionban command whenever an IP is banned, triggering the ban on 127.0.0.1 ensures that the malicious command runs immediately on the same system without external dependencies.\nBecauseFail2Ban runs with elevated privileges, the shell was spawned with root access, successfully granting me full control over the system.\nWith the root shell successfully obtained, I navigated to the /root directory and accessed the final flag!\nBack To Home螥\n","date":"2025-11-24T01:22:11-09:00","description":"A box to test your enumeration and privilege escalation skills","permalink":"https://blog.r3d-z3e.me/posts/billing/","tags":["Enumeration"],"title":"BILLING"},{"categories":["API Security"],"content":"What is Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client There are three main types of authentication - Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;knowledge factors\u0026rdquo;. - Something you have, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;possession factors\u0026rdquo;. - Something you are or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;inherence factors\u0026rdquo;. Authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify one or more of these factors. What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be while Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something. For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username Carlos123 really is the same person who created the account. Once Carlos123 is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorized to do. For example, they may be authorized to access personal information about other users, or perform actions such as deleting another user\u0026rsquo;s account. How do Authentication Vulnerabilities arise Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways: - The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks. - Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called \u0026ldquo;broken authentication\u0026rdquo;. Note: In many areas of web development, logic flaws cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, it\u0026rsquo;s very likely that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues. What is the impact of vulnerable authentication The impact of authentication vulnerabilities can be severe. If an attacker bypasses authentication or brute-forces their way into another user\u0026rsquo;s account, they have access to all the data and functionality that the compromised account has. If they are able to compromise a high-privileged account, such as a system administrator, they could take full control over the entire application and potentially gain access to internal infrastructure. Even compromising a low-privileged account might still grant an attacker access to data that they otherwise shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have, such as commercially sensitive business information. Even if the account does not have access to any sensitive data, it might still allow the attacker to access additional pages, which provide a further attack surface. Often, high-severity attacks are not possible from publicly accessible pages, but they may be possible from an internal page. Vulnerabilities in a password-based login For websites that adopt a password-based login process, users either register for an account themselves or they are assigned an account by an administrator. This account is associated with a unique username and a secret password, which the user enters in a login form to authenticate themselves. In this scenario, the fact that they know the secret password is taken as sufficient proof of the user\u0026rsquo;s identity. This means that the security of the website is compromised if an attacker is able to either obtain or guess the login credentials of another user. This can be achieved in a number of ways. The following sections show how an attacker can use brute-force attacks, and some of the flaws in brute-force protection. You\u0026rsquo;ll also learn about the vulnerabilities in HTTP basic authentication. Brute Force Attacks A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials. These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords. Automating this process, especially using dedicated tools, potentially enables an attacker to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed. Brute-forcing is not always just a case of making completely random guesses at usernames and passwords. By also using basic logic or publicly available knowledge, attackers can fine-tune brute-force attacks to make much more educated guesses. This considerably increases the efficiency of such attacks. Websites that rely on password-based login as their sole method of authenticating users can be highly vulnerable if they do not implement sufficient brute-force protection. Brute-forcing Usernames Usernames are especially easy to guess if they conform to a recognizable pattern, such as an email address. For example, it is very common to see business logins in the format firstname.lastname@somecompany.com However, even if there is no obvious pattern, sometimes even high-privileged accounts are created using predictable usernames, such as admin or administrator. During auditing, check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly. For example, are you able to access user profiles without logging in? Even if the actual content of the profiles is hidden, the name used in the profile is sometimes the same as the login username. You should also check HTTP responses to see if any email addresses are disclosed. Occasionally, responses contain email addresses of high-privileged users, such as administrators or IT support. Brute-forcing Passwords Passwords can similarly be brute-forced, with the difficulty varying based on the strength of the password. Many websites adopt some form of password policy, which forces users to create high-entropy passwords that are, theoretically at least, harder to crack using brute-force alone. This typically involves enforcing passwords with: - A minimum number of characters - A mixture of lower and uppercase letters - At least one special character However, while high-entropy passwords are difficult for computers alone to crack, we can use a basic knowledge of human behavior to exploit the vulnerabilities that users unwittingly introduce to this system. Rather than creating a strong password with a random combination of characters, users often take a password that they can remember and try to crowbar it into fitting the password policy. For example, if mypassword is not allowed, users may try something like Mypassword1! or Myp4$$w0rd instead. In cases where the policy requires users to change their passwords on a regular basis, it is also common for users to just make minor, predictable changes to their preferred password. For example, Mypassword1! becomes Mypassword1? or Mypassword2!. This knowledge of likely credentials and predictable patterns means that brute-force attacks can often be much more sophisticated, and therefore effective, than simply iterating through every possible combination of characters. Username Enumeration Username enumeration is when an attacker is able to observe changes in the website\u0026rsquo;s behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid. Username enumeration typically occurs either on the login page, for example, when you enter a valid username but an incorrect password, or on registration forms when you enter a username that is already taken. This greatly reduces the time and effort required to brute-force a login because the attacker is able to quickly generate a shortlist of valid usernames. While attempting to brute-force a login page, you should pay particular attention to any differences in: Status codes: During a brute-force attack, the returned HTTP status code is likely to be the same for the vast majority of guesses because most of them will be wrong. If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct Error messages: Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND password are incorrect or only the password was incorrect. It is best practice for websites to use identical, generic messages in both cases, but small typing errors sometimes creep in. Response times: If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, any that deviate from this suggest that something different was happening behind the scenes. This is another indication that the guessed username might be correct. For example, a website might only check whether the password is correct if the username is valid.
