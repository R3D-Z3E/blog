            <h2 id="-about-me">👋 About Me</h2>
<p>Hiii, I’m a security researcher and penetration tester with a blend of offensive and defensive experience, focused on penetration testing, network security, and cloud environments. I work extensively with Linux systems, Active Directory, and scripting to understand how real infrastructures operate and where they are most vulnerable.</p>
<p>I leverage frameworks like OWASP Top 10 and MITRE ATT&amp;CK to strengthen security posture, while also practicing proactive defense through SIEM and threat hunting. Currently pursuing the OSCP certification, I enjoy challenges that bridge hands-on security research with real-world impact.</p>

<h2 id="-the-craft-i-spend-most-days-on">💻 The Craft I Spend Most Days On</h2>
<p>I got into Infosec at a time when I needed focus and direction. I was looking for something demanding enough to fully engage my attention and channel my energy into growth. Cybersecurity became that outlet. Driven by curiosity, I began teaching myself through platforms like TryHackMe, YouTube, and community forums, learning the hard way through experimentation, failure, and persistence.</p>
<p>Over time, I built a strong foundation across core security domains threat modeling, vulnerabilities and exploits, cryptography, cloud and virtualization, operational security, and incident response. I reinforced this knowledge through hands-on labs and real-world simulations on platforms such as Hack The Box, HackMyVM, PortSwigger, and Vulnix, where theory quickly turned into muscle memory.</p>
<p>CTFs played a major role in shaping how I think. Competing in Boot2Root challenges led me to join a CTF team, sharpening my skills in enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation. More importantly, they taught me how to approach problems creatively, stay methodical under pressure, and learn from failure.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’ve worked as both a web application penetration tester and a network penetration tester, gaining real-world experience across diverse environments. My work has involved assessing web applications, internal networks, Active Directory infrastructures, and Linux systems  translating technical findings into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders. Along the way, I strengthened my collaboration and communication skills by working with teams across different cultures and time zones.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to have some my penetration testing certifications sponsored, and even more fortunate to be part of a global security community filled with people I respect and learn from daily like (Ben heater, secfortress, ipsalmy, kurrupt, blackanon, venom, cocofelon, j4ndy, en route to better days, Jay, Ladeeee). I’m driven by continuous learning, ethical hacking, and the challenge of securing systems in real-world environments.</p>
<p>I’m always looking to grow, contribute, and take on problems that push me beyond my comfort zone.</p>

<h2 id="life-beyond-security">Life Beyond Security</h2>
<p>Outside of security, I’m currently pursuing a <strong>BSc in Computer Science</strong>, strengthening the fundamentals that support how I think and work in infosec. Music is my therapy, a way to slow down, reset, and find clarity when things get heavy. I’m also a football enthusiast, drawn to the discipline, strategy, and emotion that come with the game.</p>
<p>I enjoy <strong>writing my thoughts</strong> as a form of reflection and grounding. It helps me organize ideas, process experiences, and stay intentional, both personally and professionally. These spaces beyond the work are an essential part of how I stay focused, balanced, and curious.</p>
<h3 id="-future-plans">✨ Future plans</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, my goal is to grow into a <strong>red team–focused security researcher</strong>, with a strong emphasis on understanding systems at a deeper level rather than relying solely on tools. I want to continue studying attacker tradecraft, modern detection techniques, and how real-world adversaries operate across complex environments.</p>
<p>I plan to invest more time in <strong>security research</strong>, including exploit development, Active Directory abuse paths, and post-exploitation techniques, while staying closely aligned with defensive perspectives to better understand detection and response. Long term, I aim to contribute original research, share knowledge with the community, and take on work that pushes beyond checklists into realistic adversary simulation.</p>
